# TensorRT Integration Status

## Current Implementation

‚úÖ **Infrastructure Complete**: TensorRT pipeline wrapper and integration logic has been implemented  
‚úÖ **Model Detection**: Successfully detects and resolves TensorRT model paths  
‚úÖ **RTX 5090 Support**: Optimized for your hardware with BF16/FP8 precision support

## Current Issue

‚ùå **ONNX Runtime Compatibility**: The TensorRT-optimized ONNX models require:
1. Specific ONNX Runtime version with TensorRT execution provider
2. NVIDIA TensorRT libraries properly configured
3. CUDA toolkit compatibility

The current error indicates the ONNX models contain operators that aren't supported by the standard ONNX Runtime build.

## Working Configuration

‚úÖ **Standard SD 3.5**: The `SD3.5-Large` model now uses `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large` which:
- Works with standard diffusers pipeline
- Supports IP-Adapter integration
- Utilizes RTX 5090 optimizations (BF16, flash attention, etc.)
- Provides excellent image quality and performance

## TensorRT Model Options

The TensorRT model (`SD3.5-Large-TensorRT`) is available in the model list but requires proper TensorRT runtime setup.

## Path Forward

To enable TensorRT acceleration in the future:

1. **Install NVIDIA TensorRT**: Proper TensorRT libraries and ONNX Runtime TensorRT build
2. **Docker Environment**: Use NVIDIA's official TensorRT containers
3. **Alternative**: Use Torch-TensorRT for PyTorch model optimization

For now, the standard SD 3.5 model provides excellent performance on your RTX 5090 with all StoryDiffusion features working perfectly.

## Performance

Even without TensorRT, your RTX 5090 with 24GB VRAM provides:
- ‚ö° Fast inference with BF16 precision
- üî• Flash attention acceleration  
- üíæ Efficient memory usage
- üé® Full IP-Adapter support for character consistency
